### Functional Programming VS Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Which is better….?

#### Functional Programming 
Functional programming is the form of programming that attempts to avoid changing state and mutable data.
 In a functional program, the output of a function should always be the same, given the same exact inputs to the function. \
This is because the outputs of a function in functional programming purely relies on arguments of the function, and there is no magic
 that is happening behind the scenes. This is called eliminating side effects in your code. \
For example, if you call function getSum() it calculates the sum of two inputs and returns the sum. 
Given the same inputs for x and y, we will always get the same output for sum. \
From a maintenance, logical and structural standpoint, functional programming excels when there are no histories to deal with. 
It works particularly well when there are no boundaries required, or those boundaries are already predefined. 
It thrives in situations where the state is not a factor and there is very little to no involvement with mutable data. \
Functional programming provides the advantages like efficiency, lazy evaluation, nested functions, bug-free code, parallel programming. 
In simple language, functional programming is to write the function having statements to execute a particular task for the application. 
Each small function does its part and only its part. The function can be easily invoked and reused at any point. 
It also helps the code to be managed and the same thing or statements does not need to be written again and again. 
It allows for very modular and clean code that all works together in harmony. \

#### Object Oriented Programming - OOP
Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm in which you program using objects to represent things you are programming about (sometimes real world things). 
These objects could be data structures. The objects hold data about them in attributes. 
The attributes in the objects are manipulated through methods or functions that are given to the object. \
For instance, we might have a Person object that represents all of the data a person would have: weight, height, skin color, hair color, hair length, and so on. 
Those would be the attributes. Then the person object would also have things that it can do such as: pick box up, put box down, eat, sleep, etc. 
These would be the functions that play with the data the object stores. \
The main deal with OOP is the ability to encapsulate data from outsiders. 
Encapsulation is the ability to hide variables within the class from outside access — 
which makes it great for security reasons, along with leaky, unwanted or accidental usage. 
Most programmers using object oriented design say that it is a style of programming that allows you to model real world scenarios much simpler. 
This allows for a good transition from requirements to code that works like the customer or user wants it to. \

### What Are the Four Basics of Object-Oriented Programming?

#### What is object-oriented programming?
Object-oriented programming combines a group of variables (properties) and functions (methods) into a unit called an "object." 
These objects are organized into classes where individual objects can be grouped together. 
OOP can help you consider objects in a program's code and the different actions that could happen in relation to the objects. \
This programming style widely exists in commonly used programming languages like Java, C++ and PHP. 
These languages help simplify the structure and organization of software programs. 
Programmers often use OOP when they need to create complex programs. \

#### What are the four basics of object-oriented programming?
Object-oriented programming has four basic concepts: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. 
Even if these concepts seem incredibly complex, understanding the general framework of how they work will help you understand 
the basics of a computer program. Here are the four basic theories and what they entail: \
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

##### Encapsulation
The different objects inside of each program will try to communicate with each other automatically. 
If a programmer wants to stop objects from interacting with each other, they need to be encapsulated in individual classes. 
Through the process of encapsulation, classes cannot change or interact with the specific variables and functions of an object. \
Just like a pill "encapsulates" or contains the medication inside of its coating, 
the principle of encapsulation works in a digital way to form a protective barrier around the information that separates it 
from the rest of the code. Programmers can replicate this object throughout different parts of the program or other programs. \

##### Abstraction
Abstraction is like an extension of encapsulation because it hides certain properties and methods from the outside 
code to make the interface of the objects simpler. Programmers use abstraction for several beneficial reasons. 
Overall, abstraction helps isolate the impact of changes made to the code so that if something goes wrong, 
the change will only affect the variables shown and not the outside code. \

##### Inheritance
Using this concept, programmers can extend the functionality of the code's existing classes to eliminate repetitive code. 
For instance, elements of HTML code that include a text box, select field and checkbox have certain properties in common with 
specific methods. \
Instead of redefining the properties and methods for every type of HTML element, you can define them once in a generic object. 
Naming that object something like "HTMLElement" will cause other objects to inherit its properties and methods so you can reduce 
unnecessary code. \
The main object is the superclass and all objects that follow it are subclasses. 
Subclasses can have separate elements while adding what they need from the superclass. \

##### Polymorphism
This technique meaning "many forms or shapes" allows programmers to render multiple HTML elements depending on the type of object. 
This concept allows programmers to redefine the way something works by changing how it is done or by changing the parts in which it is 
done. Terms of polymorphism are called overriding and overloading. \
